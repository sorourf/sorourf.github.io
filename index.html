                <p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
                
<p>My research focuses on advancing large language models (LLMs) for financial applications and understanding their decision-making processes. I develop multi-agent frameworks that enable LLMs to process diverse data types—including text, charts, and numerical information—for tasks such as financial text classification, stock market prediction, and question answering. These systems incorporate reflection mechanisms that allow agents to learn from past decisions and improve their reasoning over time.</p>

<p>My current work investigates fundamental questions about LLM decision-making: how do multi-agent LLM systems compare to traditional machine learning approaches on structured data? Do LLMs develop human-like biases when learning from sequential feedback under risk? I am also developing methods that combine immediate reasoning evaluation with long-term outcome estimation for improved decision-making in domains with delayed feedback. Additionally, I study corporate AI disclosure practices, developing methods to detect misalignment between firms' AI-related claims and their actual investments.</p>
