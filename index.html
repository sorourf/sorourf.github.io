                <p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
                
                <p>I received my PhD from University of Illinois Chicago in December 2024, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://yuhenghu.com/" target="_blank">Yuheng Hu</a>. My research focuses on advancing large language models through multi-agent frameworks and understanding their decision-making processes in financial and business contexts. My work combines natural language processing, machine learning, and econometric methods to develop AI systems that can process diverse data modalities and make complex decisions under uncertainty.</p>
                
                <p>My research contributes to the fields of Information Systems and AI in Finance, and has been published in top-tier journals and conferences including ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, and PLoS ONE.</p>
                
                <p>You can find additional information about my work <a href="research.html">here</a>.</p>
