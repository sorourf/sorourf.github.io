            <p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
            
            <p>My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and decision-making, with particular emphasis on large language models (LLMs) and their application to real-world problems. I investigate how LLMs perform on structured data tasks, comparing their capabilities with traditional AutoML systems, and explore whether these models develop human-like decision biases when learning from sequential feedback under risk. Additionally, I work on enhancing AI reasoning in complex environments with delayed feedback, such as financial trading, by integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search methods with LLM-based evaluation systems. This work has broader implications for strategic planning, medical diagnosis, and policy modeling.</p>
